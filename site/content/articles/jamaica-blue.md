“El Clasico” and Democracy in Spain





On 1st October 2017 goals from Sergio Busquets and Lionel Messi helped Barcelona FC to a victory over Canary Islanders, Las Palmas. It was a seventh straight win for the Catalan side and upon glancing at the scoresheet, one would be forgiven for thinking there was nothing unusual about the afternoon’s events. However the Camp Nou, its high terraces usually thickened with the red and yellow of the Senyera and with the voices of more than ninety-thousand Catalans was unsettling silent, in stark contrast to the chaos that had erupted on the city streets of Barcelona.  





The Spanish’s state’s Guardia Civil had just that day attempted to disrupt the Catalan region’s illegal independence referendum with rubber bullets and baton charges, evoking memories of the city’s troubled past with the Madrid government. In an emotional post-match interview, Barcelona defender Gerard Pique, himself a native of Catalonia, offered to stand down from the Spanish national side if deemed a ‘problem’. ‘In the Franco era we couldn’t defend our ideas’ he remarked ‘I am, and I feel Catalan, and I am very proud of the people, of their behaviour’. 





Whilst to most outsiders it would appear unusual for an international footballer to be drawn so outspokenly into the world of politics, Spain is a land where politics and football have long been intertwined. This relationship is most evident in the great rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona; known to supporters simply as El Clasico. This is because both teams are representative of the tensions that lie at the very heart of Spain, tensions that have risen to the fore in recent months. The imperious Real Madrid, the foremost side in the nation’s capital and the most decorated team in European history, are representative of the Spanish state’s continual drive towards centralisation. Barcelona on the other hand as natives of Catalonia have long been a beacon for Spain’s regions, perpetually pushing against this centralising tendency, manifested in the club motto “Mes que un club” (“More than a club”). Not only has the Clasico rivalry held a mirror to the very nature of the Spanish nation, it has even served to exacerbate tensions, as the realms of football and politics became inseparable during the Franco dictatorship. As the forces of centralism and regionalism have battled for supremacy in the nation’s politics, so the fortunes of both clubs have waxed and waned with the changing nature of the Spanish state. 
              





The origins of the great intensity of El Clasico lie in the stark differences between the two cities that give its antagonists their names. In the view of Eric Hobsbawm ‘The imagined community of millions seems more real as a team of eleven named people’. As such, so distinct are Madrid and Barcelona in language, culture, politics and tradition that the fixture has more the feel of an international rivalry than a merely national one. 
      



Madrid, the physical manifestation of the Spanish state, geographically and symbolically occupies its centre. Owing to its geography, it experiences summers of intense heat and winters of intense cold. It possesses no major ports or rivers and as such has relied on the doctrine of centralism. Along with the Basque region to the north, with its own distinct footballing tradition, Catalonia has long pushed against this drive towards the centre. In contrast to Madrid, Barcelona, the capital city of the Catalan region, lies where the north-easterly coast of Spain juts out into the Mediterranean Sea. The city has through its history enjoyed considerable periods of autonomy. Its significance to Spain grew in the 19th century when it became a major centre of industrialisation, its cultural renaissance heralding the growth of a Catalan national identity. It is unsurprising then that two cities built on such distinct traditions and histories should yield football clubs that would grow to so keenly represent them.       





The aforementioned political tensions rose to the fore in the first meeting between the two teams in 1902. A small tournament was held to commemorate the crowning of King Alfonso XIII, featuring among other sides, two clubs from Barcelona and two from Madrid. In this first encounter Barcelona triumphed over Madrid, then known more humbly as Madrid FC, 2-1, before falling themselves 3-1 in the final to the Basque side Vizcaya. However the organisers were dismayed to see a tournament held in honour of a Castilian monarch dominated by sides from Catalonia and the Basque Country. A “third-place play-off” was thus swiftly arranged and widely-publicised in the media, with the “trophy” likely ‘something hastily brought along from somebody’s personal silver collection.’ 
       





Barcelona FC’s inextricable relationship with Catalonia developed in the years that followed. The origin of the club’s motto “Mes que un club” has been attributed to Joan Camper, the club’s president from 1908. The club actively involved itself with Catalan nationalism and in 1918 came out strongly in favour of a statute of autonomy for the region. Real Madrid’s reputation as recipients of the patronage of the Spanish state was confirmed in 1920 when the ‘royal’ title was bestowed to them and the royal crown emblem emblazoned above the club’s crest. However it would not be until the Franco dictatorship that the politics and football of Spain developed from a reflection of the nation’s politics to the active involvement of the state. 
       





The Spanish Second Republic was proclaimed in 1931 when King Alfonso abdicated, following the results of the country’s municipal elections in which anti-monarchist parties swept up a majority of votes. In the same year, Spain’s Republican government granted the Catalan and Basque regions greater autonomy. The Spanish Republic was turbulent and short-lived, the country’s politics increasingly polarised between a communist-aligned Left and a reactionary Right. When a military coup was sprung in July 1936, few were surprised, but when General Franco’s Nationalists were unable to deliver a decisive blow, a long and bitter Civil War became inevitable. The two sides were evenly matched, the Republican government clinging onto the majority of Spain’s major cities. However Franco was dealt a critical advantage in the neutrality of Britain and France and the overt support given to him by Mussolini’s Italy and Hitler’s Germany. 
       





Until its fall in the winter of 1938, Catalonia remained one of the fiercest points of resistance to the Nationalist forces, its role in the War immortalised in George Orwell’s Homage to Catalonia. General Franco was aware of Barcelona’s significance to the Republican cause and its football team did not escape the violence. The club’s chairman, Josep Sunyol, was murdered by paramilitary Falangist forces loyal to the Nationalists, rendering inadequate Orwell’s phrase likening competitive sport to war without the shooting. The Civil War consumed the entire country and it was inevitable that Real Madrid would also be caught up in the violence. Santiago Bernabéu Yeste, Madrid forward and subsequent chairman whose name now adorns the club’s stadium, fought on the side of Franco’s Nationalists. Yet it was the fall of Madrid to Franco in 1939 that heralded the General’s brutal ordering of the country.
       





Newly victorious, General Franco had no intention of ruling with magnanimity. The country was divided along the lines of the victors and the vanquished and the early years of his rule saw power consolidated through the brutal suppression of opposition. In Catalonia alone at least 4,000 were summarily executed between 1938 and 1953. Franco’s dictatorship was characterised by the excessive centralisation of political power through networks of state patronage, the use of intimidation and coercion and the suppression of Spain’s historically autonomous regions. Catalonia was no exception; the Catalan language was outlawed along with the region’s customs. Symbolic of these changes, Barcelona were forced to change their name from the Catalan styled FC Barcelona, to the Spanish styled Barcelona CF and the Catalan crest was stripped from the badge. Franco understood Barcelona’s football team to be a source of Catalan pride, deeply aware of the fact that the Camp Nou remained one of the last bastions in which the Catalan language could be spoken freely. 
              





In the interwar years, football was increasingly becoming an important cultural symbol and Franco understood its potential importance to his Nationalist cause. It was a notion that had not escaped Benito Mussolini, Italy’s Fascist dictator, who persuaded FIFA to grant the 1934 World Cup to Italy.  The domineering Franco thus began to cast his influence on football, entering into what E.P. Thompson refers to as ‘the theatre of the great’, making a habit of attending matches and in 1943 renaming the Copa Del Rey (Spain’s equivalent of the FA Cup) to the Generalisimo’s Cup. 
       





The Francoist state monopolised football and Franco offered his patronage to Real Madrid, intent on building up Los Blancos as a Catholic, conservative rival to Barcelona. Madrid, at the centre of Spain was the crucible of the General’s power, the physical and symbolic embodiment of his ambition to impress Castilian Spanish on the regions and the embodiment of his desire to rule from and amass power at the centre. Franco’s power in this regard was first nakedly displayed in the 1943 semi-final of the Cup between the two sides. Barcelona had been victorious in their home leg, winning 3-0 and were in the clear advantage going into the reverse fixture. The game had been notable for the Camp Nou’s jeering of the Madrid players, who they deemed the personification of their Francoist oppressors and in response, the pro-Madrid press had elevated tensions heading into the return fixture. The Barcelona players were subjected to unprecedented hostility from the Madrid terraces and swiftly capitulated, ultimately suffering a humiliating 11-1 defeat. The tie however was more notable for the visit paid to the Barcelona dressing-room before the game by Franco’s director of security, who supposedly referred to the Catalans’ lack of patriotism and reminded them that they were only permitted to play on account of the generosity of the regime. Real Madrid however failed to capitalise on state patronage in the 1940s, failing to win a title for the first fourteen years of Franco’s dictatorship. 
       





It was in the 1950s that Franco began to display his power and influence over football much more overtly, demonstrated by his courting of the Argentine forward, Alfredo di Stefano. Di Stefano, a native of Buenos Aires, began his career at the city’s River Plate before a spell playing for Millonarios of Bogota on account of a footballers’ strike in Argentina in 1949. It was with the Colombians that the Argentine entranced the Spanish crowds with his brilliance during a friendly competition in Madrid. Though Real Madrid showed interest, Barcelona moved the quickest, reaching an agreement over the transfer with River, still di Stefano’s employers. 
       



However, in his customary coercive style, Franco aimed to disrupt the deal, allegedly bribing Barcelona’s chief scout, who in turn entrusted the Millonarios side of the deal to the director of Millonarios’ Colombian rivals, Santa Fe. The director deliberately offered a derisory price, allowing Madrid to swoop in and conclude a deal with the Colombians. FIFA however ignored Madrid’s deal and considered di Stefano a Barcelona player. Franco once more showed his hand, passing a law outlawing the purchase of foreign players before brokering a deal in which di Stefano would alternate yearly between Barcelona and Real. 
       





Barcelona consequently capitulated, their chairman resigning under the pressure of Catalan nationalists and an interim board handing di Stefano’s rights in full to Madrid. Di Stefano “The Blonde Arrow” would subsequently become one of Real’s greatest ever players. Considered one of the finest to have ever played the game, di Stefano was impressed with legendary stamina and technical brilliance. On his debut he netted a hat-trick against Barcelona, but this was just the beginning. Madrid dominated domestically and at the European level throughout the 1950s, aided by di Stefano’s impressive goal tallies. The Argentine would lift ten domestic titles with Los Blancos and five consecutive European cups between 1956 and 1960, scoring in every final. With Franco aiming to propel the Spanish national side to World Cup glory, di Stefano was nationalised in 1956 despite previously representing both Argentina and Colombia. Ultimately the dream was never realised, Spain failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1954 and 1958 and injury kept di Stefano out in 1962. Even so, the affair was illustrative of the incestuous relationship between football and the state in this era.       





Real Madrid then, backed by the strong arm of the Francoist state, dominated Spanish and European football in the aftermath of the Second World War. Despite this, Los Blancos did not possess an entirely unblemished record against their Catalan rivals during the 1960s. El Clasico could not have been described as such if Barcelona had not recorded at least a few of their own successes. In the infamous 1968 ‘Bottle Final’ of the Generalisimo’s Cup, the Catalans held onto a 1-0 lead despite the storm of bottles that rained down upon them from the tempestuous terraces of the Bernebeau and went on to lift the trophy in front of Franco himself. It was not until the 1970s, the final decade of Franco’s rule, that Barcelona would truly summon the temerity to challenge Real’s supremacy.       





The signing of the Dutch star Johan Cruyff from Ajax in 1973 was a significant turning point, not just in the history of El Clasico, but in the history of Spain, for it coincided with the decaying of Francoist power and heralded the nation’s return to democracy. Barcelona had first challenged the declining order in circumventing the Francoist law banning the signing of foreign players, demonstrating its endemic corruption. The capture of the mercurial and charismatic Cruyff, perhaps the greatest player of his generation, served to reinvigorate not just Barcelona as a football club, but the entire Catalan region. Beginning his career with Ajax, Cruyff had helped to transform the Dutch side into one of the greatest in Europe, winning three consecutive European cups before signing for the Catalans. His brand of ‘Total Football’, famously showcased to the world by the 1974 Dutch World Cup side, revolutionised the game and impressed upon Catalonia a new-found confidence that would see the region flourish in the post-Franco age.       





Though Real had agreed a fee with Ajax, Cruyff publicly declared that he would never play for a club associated with a dictator. At the start of the 1973-74 season, the Catalans languished in seventeenth place, winning only two of their first seven matches before the arrival of the Dutchman. On his debut however, Cruyff scored a brace in a 4-0 victory over Granada and inspired Barcelona to their first domestic title since 1960. In that year the Catalans went undefeated, a season that included a legendary 5-0 victory over Madrid in front of a stunned Bernabeau, in which Cruyff scored a magnificent solo goal and assisted two others. A few days previous had seen the birth of Cruyff’s son, Jordi, who would later represent both Barcelona and Manchester United. The name “Jordi”, whilst eternally endearing Cruyff to Catalonia was also significant in the sense that it demonstrated the resurgence of Catalonia and the declining power of the old dictator. “Jordi” is a Catalan name and as such its usage had been outlawed by the Francoist state. 
       



Just a year later Franco was dead and in 1978 Spain was returned to democracy for the first time in thirty years. In 1979 a new Statute of Autonomy was granted to Spain’s regions and the Catalan language was granted a co-official status with Spanish. The signing of Cruyff can thus be regarded as a watershed moment, as in footballing and political terms the balance of power shifted dramatically away from the centre.



 However, the return to democracy has done little to appease the historic tensions between the Spanish state and the nation’s regions.  In similar fashion Spain’s return to democracy has failed to quell the smouldering intensity of El Clasico. The rise of Barcelona in the intervening years has only contributed to a mutually-held animosity. Cruyff returned to the Camp Nou in 1988 to apply his brand of ‘Total Football’ as first-team coach. In this period Cruyff added the likes of Michael Laudrup, Ronald Koeman and Pep Guardiola, later to become captain and manager, to his side. Cruyff’s ‘Dream Team’ won four La Liga titles in a row between 1991 and 1994 and the European Cup that had eluded Cruyff as a Barcelona player in 1992. The continued intensity of the rivalry was exemplified by the transfer of Luis Figo from Barcelona to Real in 2000. Upon his return to the Camp Nou representing Los Blancos, the Portuguese was assailed from the stands with objects that included a knife and a pig’s head. 
         





The historical tensions which lie at the heart of the Spanish state have risen to the surface in recent months. The balance of power between the mutually antagonistic centre and the regions has both coincided with and directly altered the fortunes of two of Spain’s most historic teams. Both Real Madrid and Barcelona grew in importance to the Spanish nation as football grew into an increasingly important cultural symbol in the wake of the victory of General Franco’s Nationalists. By this time both teams had become competing visions of Spain, Madrid emblazoned with the royal badge and impressed with state patronage and Barcelona a beacon to Catalan nationalists and Spain’s regions. Partly as a result of state interference, most notably in the di Stefano affair, Real Madrid dominated Spanish football during the years of the dictatorship. Barcelona’s signing of Johan Cruyff in 1974 was not only representative of the decline of Francoist power and the resurrection of Catalonia, but also acted as one of its driving forces. With Spain’s return to democracy in 1978, power shifted away from the centre and it was Barcelona’s turn to dominate the game under Cruyff’s revolutionary management. In the years leading up to the present crisis, both Real Madrid and Barcelona have assumed periods of dominance. The great personal contest between Real’s Cristiano Ronaldo and Barcelona’s Lionel Messi has only deepened a rivalry which, along with the aforementioned tensions, shows no signs of abating.
