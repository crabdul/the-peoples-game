<br />

Just imagine for a moment, a game of football played out between three teams, rather than two. How would scoring work? Would this game be collaborative, competitive, or both? What shape would the pitch be? Would this game also take on a novel dynamic, a strange and peculiar rhythm of its own? Could it ever catch on?

<br />

In fact, such a game exists, with new leagues springing up around the world, from Belarus to Bogotá, Melbourne to Malawi, Borneo to Bilbao. Played by three teams, between three goals, usually on a hexagonal pitch, three-sided football (3SF) presents a unique, transformative reworking of traditional football’s binary logic. According to its provisional codification, stemming from the game’s 1990s re-discovery, there are only three rules: Firstly, naturally, there are three teams. Secondly, victory falls to the team who concedes the fewest, rather than scores the most. Thirdly, finally, the ball must be round. 

<br />

With 3SF however, things are rarely so straightforward. Games frequently take a turn for the unexpected and even this minimal basis enjoys (ir)regular diversions. Each game is not only a contest, but also a negotiation, of strategy and subterfuge. Traditional ball skills become entangled with an intuition for the game’s grammar and logic, plus the requisite rhetorical dexterity to convince one’s opponents to abandon an attack and turn on each other instead. For this 3SF has sometimes been spun as a collision of conventional football, chess and poker. Weaving collaboration and betrayal into the competitive fabric of two-sided sports, teams make and break alliances through dizzying tactical twists. The following sketch will unpick 3SF’s disputed beginnings, themselves no less labyrinthine, as well as examining some deeper questions the game throws up. 

<br />

This is no easy task. Key source on 3SF, The -Book of Deptford (nd.), records no less than twenty-three varying interpretations of the game (2).  These range widely, from those suggesting 3SF represents the folkloric survival of early forms of ritualised social bonding, to others regarding it as a purely modern invention: an experimental analogy, devised for modelling aspects of contemporary physics. 

<br />

Explanations for 3SF’s emergence range from the philosophical to the conspiratorial, yet perhaps the least plausible are those that dismiss it as simply an “art” intervention. Though widespread, these theories are a rather late interpolation; no evidence exists for the game having featured in artistic contexts prior to 2006 (3).  The recent coincidental occurrence of the 3SF World Cup in Kassel, Germany, simultaneous to the town’s famous arts festival, was therefore just that, a coincidence. Most three-sided footballers in attendance were far more interested in the town’s historic role in propagating the Rosicrucian movement, arguably something much more integral to the game’s development (4).  Similarly, owing to misconceptions that place 3SF’s origins in the 1960s, with the work of Asger Jorn, a well-known Danish artist and member of the avant-garde Situationist International, the game has further come to be associated with that limited sphere of activity (5).  

<br />

According to this theory, 3SF is merely a happy accident; it was never really meant it to be played. Proponents of this “Jornian” origin suggest it arose from a brief, hypothetical digression in the painter’s 1962 musings (6).  An idiosyncratic metaphor, a thought experiment, a visualised diagram, a daydream; it was, they suggest, the creation of an artist, trying to use science to the overturn the political philosophies of his day. No sooner described than dismissed, they argue, Jorn’s metaphor might easily have remained a purely imaginative solution. Yet after thirty years of non-existence, it happened to be revived by a disparate collection of anarchists, somewhere in a park in Scotland (7).  

<br />

That the central proponents of this Jornian thesis are precisely those claiming to have revived the game that day should be enough to cast significant doubt on their assertions. It is a narrative that cements their own centrality via the dubious legitimation of artistic pedigree and one anchored, ultimately, in a “great man” reading of history.

<br />

Whilst key elements in the “Jornian” story undoubtedly took place—contemporary sources confirm as much—there are strong reasons to believe the game is actually far older (8).  The story has been turned on its head and needs to be set right way up: 3SF is not some whimsical “postmodern” variant of Association Football, but in fact long predates it (9). 

<br />

**3SF: The First 100,000 Years**

<br />

No one really knows when football in itself emerged, but when it did, it likely wasn’t understood as the specialist activity “football”, as we would it recognise today. It therefore follows, and anthropological evidence suggests, that there would have been no distinction between two-sided football and three-sided football. It is generally accepted that at the time of the game’s likely emergence the primary domestic institution was not the family, but the matrilineal clan. This produced strong bonds of horizontal solidarity between people, thus games, rituals or social gatherings, whatever we might call them, were likely conducted communally, with the free condition of each, the free condition of all (10). 

<br />

From such practices, comparative anthropology suggests, magico-social activities such as “football”—as we might now call it—emerged. But this football was communal, most likely “n-sided”, where n-stands for any given numerical value. Nevertheless, for these nomadic peoples, the cycling and dynamic motion of a non-linear three-variant contest would doubtless have made far more sense, far better reflected their lifeworld, than the static linearity of a two-sided game, where one side invariably dominates another and accumulates the spoils. 

<br />

With the advance of enclosure, settlement and agriculture one has the conditions for surpluses to arise. This means three things: a class society emerges from the accumulation of surpluses, thus one has specialisation, including in the form of religion, a priest class, who become custodians of ritual. Secondly, former matrilineal relations become patriarchal ones, initially through the formal domination of patriarchy, in a culture of ritualised king sacrifice, then its real domination, through direct male authority. Thirdly, one has the emergence of warfare, as clans fight for control of grain and cattle (11). 

<br />

Here too did football likely first split, between the common game, in which community would reproduce its concrete social bonds, and an abstracted, ritualised version, football for itself: a gender-exclusive religious ceremony, to honour the community’s social power as rendered externally—through gods, states and their earthly intercessors—played at fixed “sacred” enclosures.

<br />

Early evidence of settled football—from Bronze Age Europe, from China as a game known as Cuju, or from Mesoamerica in the Mayan period—points to the tying of games to fertility rites, or the ritualised playing out of mythological stories. In Britain, the earliest mentions of football come from Nennius, a 9th century monk and The Black Book of Carmarthen, which contains a poem known as The Apple Tree Stanzas. Intriguingly both mentions, hundreds of years apart, concern the figure of Myrddin (12).  

<br />

Myrddin—a multiple-use Bardic name—was the mythological inspiration behind the legendary magician Merlin (the name was changed by Geoffrey of Monmouth in the 12th Century because it reminded him of the French “merde”). Intriguingly, Merlin is also mentioned in several early sources as the mythical architect of Stonehenge. Might this represent a surviving folk memory of ancient connections between such sacred enclosures and ritual ball games? 

<br />

Though Jorn’s role in the game’s revival is much discussed, what is rarely mentioned is that when Jorn postulated 3SF, he was intensely engaged in producing an immense 32 Volume investigation into ancient ritual sites, stone circles and labyrinths, with archaeology professor P.V. Glob. Might Jorn’s proposed game also have drawn upon these same speculations? (13) 

<br />

A connection between prehistoric ritual sites and early ball games is supported by the work of Professor Bruce Bradley of Exeter University, whose research has suggested the use of balls in the construction of stone circles (14).  It was the discovery of over 425 Neolithic balls in the vicinity of such sites that prompted Bradley’s research and that has further reinforced these suggestions (15).  Experimental archaeology suggests the stony spheres may have served as “lasts” or moulds for the construction of stretched-leather balls, since perished.  

<br />

Similarly, customary linkages between traditional ball games and Celtic ritual festivities, for example the Cornish hyrlîan—or hurling—or the Welsh Cnapan, connect these sports with seasonal rituals of great antiquity. Is this what informs the Myrddin legend? It certainly reinforces the folkloric connection of stone circles with such games. A classic example is the Hurlers Circle in Cornwall, which, legend tells, comprises players turned to stone for playing on a Sunday, doubtless the folk memory of Christianity suppressing these Pagan sporting rites.

<br />

Current archaeology, such as the work of Professor Alex Bayliss, suggests stone circles were mainly festive gathering points for scattered tribes and thus almost certainly served, amongst other things, as stadia for such ritual games, with clans gathering together at special times of year. (16)  Much as Mesoamerican ball courts have been found to align to the solstice sun, it seems plausible that other solar aligned sites, e.g. Stonehenge, may have been similarly employed.

<br />

All of this would imply that the ritualisation of the game proceeded dialectically: functioning as both a concrete reproduction of social bonds, but also an abstracted projection of this social power onto an externalised solar deity. Such a split can only have been a reflection of the separation and enclosure wrought by an emergent class society and the state. Yet in such societies, where institutional power was much less intensive than today, it remains likely that the older of these two forms also continued to be practiced independently, with the common, wandering, n-sided and acentric versions continuing to be played alongside fixed, heliocentric varieties. As anyone with half an eye on contemporary Britain’s archaic cultural establishment can attest, superstructural phenomena can persist long after the material alignments that gave rise to them have altered. 

<br />

As well as these stone monuments, the survival of such rites into the modern game is equally connected with labyrinths, or turf mazes. In Jorn’s native Danish these are often called Trojaborg, in Welsh Caerdroi, meaning “Troy Town” or “Castle of Turns”, a name enigmatically reflecting the place of rotation in 3SF. One famous example is the survival of “Winchester Football”—or “Winkies”—at St. Catherine’s Hill, Winchester, site of the famous “Mizmaze” labyrinth (17). 

<br />

Such connections go back at least as far as the Romans, with Virgil’s Aeneid providing the earliest extant description of a 3SF game, here called “Ludus Troiae”—or “Game of Troy/Turns”—played by three teams (turmae) on horseback. The whirling motions, feints, skirmishes and truces found in the modern game are clearly recognisable here:

<br />

As files in the three squadrons all in line…

…Winding in and out of one another…

By baring backs in flight, then whirling round

… then patching up a truce

And riding side by side. So intricate

In ancient times on mountainous Crete they say

The Labyrinth, between walls in the dark,

Ran criss-cross a bewildering thousand ways

…Figured, in sport, retreats and skirmishes … (18)

<br />

The Greek writer Arrian suggests the game originated with the Roman’s Celtic auxiliaries. However, it may date to at least to the 6th Cent. BCE, based upon evidence from an Etruscan wine jug showing youths emerging from a labyrinth with the legend “TRUIA”: implying “Troia” (Troy/Turns), but also “trias” (three) (19).  This is supported by Plutarch's Life of Theseus, in which a similarly labyrinthine game of ‘turnings and returnings \[…] windings and twistings’ is described. This is here called geranos, from girum, to turn. Incidentally, the three ‘halves’ in a game of 3SF are called ‘rotations’ to this day.

<br />

This textual evidence indicates games played at such sites perhaps retained their three-sided character. This is further supported by experimental archaeology, which shows their near-circular construction better suited to non-dualist gaming configurations. Whether or not the rectilinear architecture of the Romans reached the football field is unclear. Descriptions of the Roman game Harpastrum do not elaborate, although the quadratic layout of Roman forts and villas may have made this more likely. 

<br />

Two-sided or three-sided, what is known is that the story of football in Britain after Roman rule is one of repression. The title “mob football” neatly illustrates how it was perceived amongst the medieval period’s condescending clergy. It is likely all varieties were equally repressed, although references to two-sided configurations do become more frequent at this time, perhaps under the influence of the strongly dualistic moral mythology of Christianity, suggesting the binary game may already have gained an upper hand. 

<br />

Throughout this period, the history of football is written by its enemies, mainly in the form of official decrees trying to ban it. These survive from 1287, 1314, 1349, 1389 and 1401 CE. What this catalogue of dates also suggests however, is that such efforts were unsuccessful. Communal ball-games—still including n and three-sided varieties—endured in both town and country in much the same form as they had done for centuries. Indeed, rare survivals exist into the present, for example Shrove Tuesday Football at Ashbourne, or the Haxey Hood in Lincolnshire. Despite its exponential increase, depictions of two-sided play remained the exception. Indeed, to this day many of these older traditions do not limit themselves to two-sided gameplay (20). 

<br />

**3SF and the Classical Trivium in the Learning of their Time**

<br />

The real change began in the 16th and 17th centuries. Again, this was for material reasons. Just as football’s initial transformations followed certain changes in the mode of production, so too here. Again, enclosure was the catalyst.

<br />

The emergence of an urban proto-bourgeoisie and with it the advent of European colonialism meant sweeping changes in society, not least the rise of a powerful binarist ideology: Cartesian Dualism. The emergent mercantilism was also the beginning of an agricultural revolution, which in Britain would unfold over the next two-hundred years, culminating in the Acts of Enclosure, the dispossession of the rural peasant class and thus, the provision of a proletarianised workforce to facilitate industrial revolution.

<br />

The 16th Century was a time when land enclosure was really getting started, fields were being fenced off and farmers evicted. Now, if a game of football is played on the common land between villages, one can see what happens if suddenly a whole lot of fences are placed in the way and it becomes prohibited—often upon pain of death—to trespass thereon. Football itself became enclosed, static, abstracted and more than ever, rectilinear, thus binarist.

<br />

This period was therefore marked with a range of decrees against more expansive forms of football. Yet simultaneously, it saw a flurry of rural rebellion against enclosure: from Kett’s rebellion in 1549, to the Midland Revolt and Newton Rebellions of 1607. Interestingly, these broadly coincide with Elizabeth I banning football within the City of London in 1572; clearly its rural suppression meant the game was beginning to follow an emergent proletariat into the cities. Equally, for the next two centuries football became a far more politicised activity, often directly tied into the destruction of enclosures, pulling down fences, or simply, through its seasonal games, directly reasserting peoples’ rights to common land in the face of threatened enclosure —a kind of “beating of the bounds”—in distant echo of those earliest communal games.

<br />

It was the London codification of modern Association Football, at the Freemason’s Tavern in 1863, which eventually enforced the two-sided version of the game at the expense of all other varieties. Yet this codification had been strongly prefigured by earlier apparent attempts from leading intellectuals like John Dee, later Sir Francis Bacon, to similarly suppress the classical “Trivium”: the arts of grammar, dialectic and rhetoric, as traditionally taught through three-sided games. Dee, it is suggested, had sought to crush the late-16th Century’s remaining three-sided sports in favour of what would become the binarist football codes preserved through England’s public school system, even as common “mob” versions were actively suppressed elsewhere. Public school varieties hence, the theory goes, came to favour the more serious “Quadrivial” format, further abstracting these games from their social fabric, instead emphasising their roll in teaching spatial mastery to the Empire’s elites (21).  Ultimately, it was these public school versions, rather than the n-sided mob games, which in 1863 became the basis of the FA’s definitive Laws of the Game. Intellectual enclosure thus followed from a physical one.

<br />

Yet why were early imperialists like Dee and Bacon so keen to suppress the Trivium? A definitive answer remains elusive. However, a note of caution must also be sounded. At this time court intrigues and an atmosphere of guarded secrecy meant writers would often adopt false personas, or even attempt to cover their tracks by writing polemics against their own true positions. As such, misdirection was rife and it remains entirely plausible that the Trivium was not so much suppressed, as occulted, in order to conceal and thus preserve its arts for the use of an exclusive elite.

<br />

Nevertheless, if one does opt to take the Trivium’s suppression at face value, a clue perhaps lies with central proponents of the Quadrivial cause, the Areopagus group, and group’s motto “A per se A” \[“A in itself A”]. This is simply a rephrasing of the first of the so-called classical Laws of Thought: the Law of Identity, the basic foundation of abstract formal logic. The root of this motto in fact stems from Euclid, as reintroduced by Dee in his 1570 commentary upon Euclid’s Elements. Euclidean geometry argued according to the structure of a few universal axioms, from which all truths might be derived. One of its chief assumptions was the law of identity, also known here as the law of superposition. Euclid had argued that a triangle could be shown to be equivalent to another triangle by lifting it up and “superposing” it on top: A=A.

<br />

The Quadrivialists, it is suggested, sought to marginalise the teachings of the Trivium—and the 3SF which supported it—precisely in order to institute a politico-scientific equivalent to Euclid’s geometrical axioms. They sought a Platonic ideal upon which all good, universal government might be based, with the material aim, of course, of revolutionising agrarian production through a centralised bureaucratic state. With hindsight, one can thus see the Trivialist cause represented a coalition of peasants with a declining faction of the ruling class—the landed aristocracy—who relied more upon traditional rhetoric, religion and linguistic obfuscation for their power. The Quadrivalist emphasis on “science” and abstraction was taken up by an ascendant bourgeoisie, whose class interests it likewise reflected in that moment.

<br />

Counter this Quadrivial ascendency, which seems to have grown to ideological dominance through “Atlanticist” Rosicrucianism, the Trivial counter-tendency unexpectedly resurfaced elsewhere, from a heretic of that same tradition, the German mystic Jakob Böhme. His doctrine concerning the mystic becoming of the Trinity: A (or God) becomes other to itself as ¬A (or Man) in order to achieve a new, higher unity as simultaneously A∧¬A (Divine becoming) displays a rhetorical, dialectical grammar, a three-phase movement that breaks down the traditional laws of abstract identity. It thus echoes the Trivialists own motto: “tria sequuntur tria” \[“three follows from three”].

<br />

That this logic bares close relation to modern 3SF will come as no surprise when one recalls it was precisely from Böhme’s doctrine—as translated into a theory of the colour wheel by the Romantic painter Philipp Otto Runge—that Jorn was inspired to revive the game (22).  That said, the formulation will still appear baffling to most players, being more akin to that of German philosopher G.W.F. Hegel and his famous dialectical system, commonly reduced to the trinity of thesis-antithesis-synthesis. For Hegel, superposition was simply the immanent relation of internal limits; revolution was not a transcendental affair.

<br />

It fell of course to Jorn, in the 20th Century, to bring this up to date, as influenced by the contemporary quantum mechanics espoused by physicist Niels Bohr. Whilst some “purists” of the Trivial camp might see this as a capitulation to Quadrivialism, Jorn instead presented it as a further superposition, of both Trivial and Quadrivial. In doing so however, Jorn thus brought a distinct meaning to the notion of superposition: quantum superposition—simultaneously particle and wave—in and for itself, superposing both “A per se A” and “tria sequuntur tria” into a single formula.

<br />

Jorn theorised this as Triolectics, developed in response to what he (mistakenly) saw as the limitations of dialectics, faced with advances in quantum physics. In doing so he proposed a super-superposition—a “pataposition”—of Marxist dialectical materialism and Bohr’s notion of “complementarity”.

<br />

**3SF Today**

<br />

Having resigned from the Situationist International, Jorn wanted to develop the “science” of situations in more playful directions, more open to the contributions of physics and mathematics, alongside those of the traditional revolutionary movement. As a proponent for left-wing communism, disillusioned by the statist capitulations of the communist movement, Jorn used triolectics to reimagine relations between individual and collective in a way that kept such categorisations open and in situational flux (23). 

<br />

Fusing dialectics with complementarity, Jorn argued dualistic polarities could be fundamentally transformed if combined into triadic relationships of complementary oppositions. Jorn used 3SF to suggest that with three elements, final closure cannot arise. The introduction of a third complementary principle enables a three-way dialectic beyond both the dualism of abstract logic, but also the implied mono-directionality of dialectics.

<br />

For Jorn, 3SF remained an imaginary solution however, he never actually played the game. Instead, it was picked up during the 1990s by the London Psychohistorical Association (LPA): as a practical means for going beyond real abstractions such as ‘art’, ‘politics’ and ‘sport’, and as an accurate model for the complexities of “Bonini’s Paradox” (24). 

<br />

Thus the game’s first contemporary iteration was organised by the print worker and LPA member Richard Essex, on Glasgow Green, in the early 1990s. Deeply disillusioned with the political activities he’d been involved with over the last twenty-years, Essex realised the failure of working class action to prevent the 1991 Gulf War reflected a new era of global capitalism and its entry into a phase of intensified subsumption. Depressed but not defeated, Essex came across the metaphor of three-sided football. Intrigued, he decided to put it into action.

<br />

The LPA was in touch with many fellow travellers across Europe and beyond, so word of 3SF quickly spread, with games springing up in Italy under the auspices of the Luther Blissett multiple-use name. Blissett had been a footballer at Watford who’d played a high profile season with AC Milan. Around 1994, a number of individuals active in the Bologna underground suggested the name as a collective identity that anyone could use. Soon leagues were being proposed across Europe under the name Luther Blissett, with the former England international inadvertently having becoming a patron of the game.

<br />

Within a few short years this experimental kick-about was launched into orbit, so to speak, by the Association of Autonomous Astronauts, a worldwide network of community groups intent on building their own space ships, thus transcending the monopoly on space travel held by corporations and the state. Three-sided football formed an important part of the AAA’s training program, teaching astronauts how to respond to varied terrains and contend with extra dimensions (25). 

<br />

Beyond Luther Blissett and the AAA, the first decade of the 21st century has seen the game taken up by advocates as disparate as a Belarusian telecoms company, an anti-gang violence initiative in Columbia, Oxford anthropologist Robin Dunbar—as the foundation for his so-called “Dunbar Number”—and by the Union of Data Miners and Psychic Workers, as a means to organise superpositionally, across national borders (26).  

<br />

**Unfinished Adventures?**

<br />

Rosicrucians, triolectics, quantum physics; you’d be forgiven for thinking this is all a long way from a Sunday afternoon kick about. But the beauty of this particular beautiful game is that its philosophy is not something abstract, concerned only with interpreting the world, rather it takes shape in the doing, in practical, collective activity. And it remains immensely good fun to boot.

<br />

Jorn (re)discovered triolectics during what he saw as a time of impasse for communism. He had just resigned from the increasingly vanguardist and doctrinaire Situationist International and was looking for new avenues to go beyond the current condition, or as the Situationists themselves had put it back in 1957, ‘for getting out of this and playing’. 

<br />

Similarly, the revival of interest in triolectics in the 1990s came at a time of decomposition in the UK left, having seen victory over the Poll Tax so rapidly turn into catastrophic defeat, in the failure to prevent war in the Gulf. The collapse of the “Soviet Union”, itself long a perversion of a communist programme, saw even the very notion of communism triumphantly declared old-hat. Perhaps triolectics again offered potential signposts for leaving these cul-de-sacs of the 20th century, for getting out of this mess and playing. 

<br />

Why should the game grow to such a renewed level of worldwide popularity now? I couldn’t say. Although of course, every day, more and more people are looking for ways out, for going beyond that closing down of thought so ruthlessly perfected by the increasingly inhospitable and crisis-prone regime of economic organisation under which we endure.

<br />

Obviously, in many ways it’s just a bit of fun, but playing three-sided football, practicing triolectics, one really does start to see things differently. It really does open up new angles on familiar problems and maybe that’s a start.

<br />

\*The collective pseudonym Eric Scorehill reflects the collective labour that has gone into this research and the fact that others, who prefer to write anonymously, have also contributed material here. Moreover, 3SF has always been a collective project anyway; there is long tradition of using collective pseudonyms when playing and writing about three-sided football
